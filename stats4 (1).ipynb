    "**Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**: PMF is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is equal to a specific value. It maps each value of the random variable to its probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability Density Function (PDF)**: PDF is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value. It gives the probability density at each point, but unlike the PMF, it doesn't directly give the probability of the variable being equal to a specific value due to the continuous nature of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \n",
    "- For a fair six-sided die, the PMF would be: \n",
    "  - PMF(1) = 1/6, PMF(2) = 1/6, ..., PMF(6) = 1/6.\n",
    "- For a continuous uniform distribution between 0 and 1, the PDF would be: \n",
    "  - PDF(x) = 1, for 0 <= x <= 1, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cumulative Density Function (CDF)**: CDF gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given value. It accumulates the probabilities up to a certain point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \n",
    "- For a fair six-sided die, the CDF would be: \n",
    "  - CDF(1) = 1/6, CDF(2) = 2/6, ..., CDF(6) = 1.\n",

    "**Bernoulli Distribution**: It models a single Bernoulli trial, which has only two possible outcomes: success (usually denoted by 1) and failure (usually denoted by 0), with a fixed probability of success (p).\n",
